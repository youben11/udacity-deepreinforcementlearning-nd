# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
Projects I worked on while following the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree at Udacity

### Grid World
Implemented the Grid World environment and an agent using a Monte Carlo method. The project is under grid_world [here](/gridworld)

### OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v2 task
My solution for the OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v2 task, solved the task using Sarsa, SarsaMax, Expected Sarsa and Constant-alpha GLIE Monte Carlo Control. You can find the listing of the results I got with each algorithm under the project dir [here](/taxi-v2)
